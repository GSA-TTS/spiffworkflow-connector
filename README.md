**SpiffWorkflow Service Connector**
=====================================

This repository contains a V2 (simplified) implementation of SpiffWorkflow's Service Connector Proxy. It provides an "Artifacts" service that can generate a PDF from an included HTML template and manage its storage in an S3 bucket.

**Overview**
------------

The Artifacts service provides two main commands:

1. `GenerateArtifact`: Takes a template name, data, and a unique ID. It generates a PDF using the Playwright library and uploads it to a configured S3 bucket.
2. `GetLinkToArtifact`: Takes an artifact ID and returns public and/or private links to the stored artifact.

This connector is designed to be flexible, supporting different S3 storage backends (like Minio for development and AWS S3 for production) through configuration.

**Features**
------------

* Generate PDFs from HTML templates using Jinja2 placeholders.
* Store generated artifacts in S3-compatible storage.
* Retrieve pre-signed and private links to stored artifacts.
* Returns a JSON response with artifact links.

**Requirements**
---------------

* Python 3.12+
* Playwright library
* Jinja2 library
* S3 bucket credentials and configuration

**Usage**
-----

1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Ensure your environment is configured with the necessary S3 credentials. See the Configuration section.
3. Use the `GenerateArtifact` command to create and store a PDF.
4. Use the `GetLinkToArtifact` command to retrieve links to an existing artifact.

**Configuration**
-----------------

The S3 connection is configured via environment variables. The following variables are required:

* `S3_ENDPOINT_URL`: The URL of the S3-compatible storage.
* `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: The access key for the S3 bucket.
* `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: The secret key for the S3 bucket.
* `S3_REGION`: The AWS region of the bucket.
* `S3_BUCKET`: The name of the S3 bucket to use.

If there's a Cloud Foundry-style VCAP_SERVICES environment variable, credentials for an S3 service named "artifacts", if present, will be used instead.


**Example**
-------

Assuming the service is running on `http://localhost:8200`, you can use the following `curl` commands.

### Generate an Artifact

This command generates a new PDF from the `blm-ce.html` template, saves it with the ID `my-test-artifact-123`, and returns links to it.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8200/v1/do/artifacts/GenerateArtifact \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "id": "my-test-artifact-123",
        "template": "blm-ce.html",
        "data": {
          "some_key": "some_value"
        },
        "generate_links": true
      }'
```

### Get a Link to an Artifact

This command retrieves the links for an existing artifact.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8200/v1/do/artifacts/GetLinkToArtifact \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "id": "my-test-artifact-123"
      }'
```

**NOTES:**

- Your template name must correspond to a file in the `/templates` directory.
- The `data` dictionary should contain keys that are referenced in the Jinja template placeholders.

### Deprecated `pdf_to_s3` command

The previous `pdf/pdf_to_s3` command is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please migrate to using the `artifacts/GenerateArtifact` command.

**Development**
--------------

To develop and test this repository, you can run `make` in a shell, which will build and start the local Docker network, including a Minio instance for storage. Running `make test` will run a test script for existing functionality.
